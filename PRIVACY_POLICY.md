# Privacy Policy for Full Page Screenshot

**Last Updated:** July 1, 2024

Thank you for using Full Page Screenshot, a browser extension developed by Akash. Your privacy is extremely important to us.

## Data Collection and Usage

The Full Page Screenshot extension **does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data.**

All functionality of the extension is performed locally on your computer. When you take a screenshot:

- The image data is processed within your browser.
- The captured image chunks are temporarily stored in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) while the final image is being assembled.
- This data is deleted from local storage as soon as the final image is presented to you on the review page.
- The final image is for you to download directly to your computer. It is never sent to any external server.

We have no access to your screenshots, your browsing history, or any other personal data.
